Coastal Sea-Level Risk Analysis for California Tide Stations
Project Overview
This project analyzes short-term sea-level trends at NOAA tide stations along the California coast and combines those trends with nearby housing values to produce a simplified coastal risk metric.

How to Run the Project
The project is designed to be run end-to-end from the Jupyter notebook, which calls functions defined in the src/ directory.
Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-repository-name>

Getting the Data (Raw Data Collection)
NOAA Tide Station and Water Level Data
Raw data is downloaded directly from NOAA APIs using functions in:
src/get_data.py

This script:
Fetches metadata for California NOAA tide stations
Downloads recent water-level time series data for each station
Saves all raw outputs to: data/raw/
Raw data files include:
ca_noaa_stations.csv
Individual station water-level CSV files stored in a time series cache
These files are created automatically when the notebook runs.
Cleaning and Processing the Data
Data cleaning and transformation handled in:
src/clean_data.py
This script:
Reads raw data from data/raw/
Attaches nearby housing values using the California Housing dataset
Prepares cleaned, merged datasets for analysis
Writes processed data to:
data/processed/
Running the Analysis
Analysis code is contained in:
src/run_analysis.py

This script:
Computes linear sea-level trends (meters per year) from water-level time series
Normalizes housing values
Computes a simplified coastal risk score
Saves final analytical datasets to:
data/processed/
The risk score is defined as:
risk = normalized sea-level trend × normalized housing value

Producing Visualizations
All visualizations are generated by:
src/visualize_results.py
This script:
Reads processed datasets from data/processed/
Produces:
Scatter plot of sea-level trend vs. housing value
Bar chart of risk scores by station
Line plot of sea-level trends
Interactive Folium map of California coastal stations
Saves outputs to: outputs/
Running Everything Together
To run the entire workflow:
Open the notebook:
notebooks/final_analysis.ipynb
Open the notebook from the results folder.
Run all cells from top to bottom.
The notebook orchestrates:
Data download
Data cleaning
Analysis
Visualization
All outputs are generated automatically in the appropriate folders.
Notes and Limitations
Sea-level trends are calculated using a short time window (default: 30 days), which may produce negative or noisy trends not reflective of long term trends.
This limitation is acknowledged and discussed as part of the project analysis.
The risk score is intended as a conceptual, instructional metric rather than a predictive model.
